                      Hello! I'm Zach Hanson, one of the co-founders of SwissCowMonkey.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      I am currently a senior at Purdue University majoring in Data Science.
                      I led the creation of the backend for our mobile application Brawlytics. I designed and implemented the database that holds user information and brawler data. Additionally, I created the model for the machine learning recommendation system.

                      Hello! I'm Adrian Szwejkowski, one of the co-founders of SwissCowMonkey.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      I am currently a junior at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign majoring in Computer Science.
                      I worked on the front-end of our mobile application Brawlytics. I designed, implemented, and tested the UI using Flutter and Dart. Additionally, I managed the authentication system using firebase and built in flutter packages.
